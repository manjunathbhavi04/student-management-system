Inversion of control is a design principle used in software development in java using spring boot,
till now we were the one who were creating objects for our classes right but now these can be handled by the spring
using the IoC design principle
for example have you ever seen a object for (Controller) class No right so the object for controller class are created
by the spring using thr IoC.
And also the life cycle of the object is managed by the spring also this is a feature of framework


Why is it called Inversion of Control
-> before we used to have the control of the object but now the framework has the control so the
   Control has been inverted from the client to the framework this is why it is called Inversion of Control.

Inversion of Control -> before we used to create the object now it is managed by the framework so the control has
been inverted
